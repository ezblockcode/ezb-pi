# class Pin - control I/O pins

Usage:
```python
from ezblock import Pin

pin = Pin("D0")                      # create an Pin object from a pin
val = pin.value()                    # read an analog value
```

## Constructors
```class ezblock.Pin(value)```
A pin is the basic object to control I/O pins. It has methods to set the mode of the pin (input, output, etc) and methods to get and set the digital logic level.

## Methods
- value - Read the value on the analog pin and return it. The returned value will be between 0 and 4095.
```python
Pin.value()
```

## Availble pins

- `"D1"`
- `"D2"`
- `"D3"`
- `"D4"`
- `"D5"`
- `"D6"`
- `"D7"`
- `"D8"`
