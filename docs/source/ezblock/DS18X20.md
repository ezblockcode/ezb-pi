# class DS18X20 - ds18x20 series temperature sensor

Usage:
```python
from ezblock import Pin, DS18X20

pin = Pin("D0")             # create pin object
ds = DS18X20(pin)           # create an DS18X20 object with PWM object

ds.read(ds.C)               # read temperature in celsius(1)
ds.read(0)                  # read temperature in Fahrenheit(0)
```
>Raspberry Pi only have one one-wire pin "D7". While Leaf works with almost every digital pins.

## Constructors
```class ezblock.DS18X20(pin)```
Create an DS18X20 object associated with the given pin object. This allows you to then read temperature from DS18X20.

## Methods
- `DS18X20.read` - read temperature with the giving unit. it returns a `float` if only one ds18x20 is connected to the pin, or it will return a list of all sensor values.
```python
DS18X20.read(unit)
```
- `DS18X20.scan` - Scan the ds18x20(s) connected to the pin, returns a list of roms address
```python
DS18X20.scan()
```
- `DS18X20.read_temp` - Read temperature(s) with the givving rom(s)
```python
DS18X20.read_temp(rom)
```

## Constants

- `DS18X20.C` - Celsius
- `DS18X20.F` - Fahrenheit
