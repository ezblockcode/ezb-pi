# class Joystick - 3-axis joystick

Usage:
```python
from ezblock import Joystick, ADC, Pin

x_pin = ADC("A0")
y_pin = ADC("A1")
btn_pin = Pin("D1")

joystick = Joystick(x_pin, y_pin, btn_pin)         # create an Joystick object from a pin
val = joystick.read(0)                             # read an axis value
status = joystick.read_status()                    # read the status of joystick
```
## Constructors
```class ezblock.Joystick(pin)```
Create an Joystick object associated with the given pin. This allows you to then read values on that pin.

## Methods
- read - Read the value on the given pin and return it. 
```python
Joystick.read(Xpin, Ypin, Btpin)
```
- read_status - Read the value on the given pin and return it. 
```python
Joystick.read_status()
```
